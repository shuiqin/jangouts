# Troubleshooting

## The browser javascript console

During execution, Jangouts logs relevant information into the JavaScript console
of the browser. Thus, if Jangouts doesn't work as expected, the browser console
is the main source of information to identify the problem. The console can be
easily activated following these instructions
[for Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Opening_the_Web_Console)
and
[for Chrome/Chromium](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/console/console-ui?hl=en#opening-the-console).

## Enabling extra debugging information

Most common problems with Jangouts are related to the communication with the
Janus gateway. If the information provided by Jangouts in the console is not
enough, it's possible to activate a more verbose mode by setting the following
parameter in `config.json`.

```json
{
  "janusDebug": true
}
```

## Checking Janus problems

If Jangouts cannot connect to Janus, the next step is to check if Janus is
running properly. If using systemd, e.g. using the mentioned (open)SUSE
packages, use ```sudo systemctl status janus.service```. If the status is
"failed", check for possible reasons in ```journalctl --unit janus.service```.
